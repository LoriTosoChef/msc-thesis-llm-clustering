The in app chat with boobs got me nowhere and they kept marking the issue as “solved” and despite my reopening and replying they just stopped responding. I was pissed. If they had offered to refund even just $5 off my order I would a have been happy but they just shrugged and ignored me. \n",
      "Almost the same thing happened with me. I got a notification that my driver couldn’t find my address. I looked outside and she was sitting in her car right outside my apartment. Clearly insight of my door with the number printed on it. She was too lazy to get out of her actual car so I texted her and she said she was lost, she watched me go outside and up to her car and wouldn’t even talk to me. Lol I have uber \n",
      "Believe it or not, this has happened to me too. Woman ran off with my pizza after making me wait an extra half hour. Contacted Uber and they were like \"don't know what to tell ya.\" Boober's customer service is pretty shitty. \n",
      "i'm glad you were able to get your money back. even if you should have gotten your food and it was no doubt a huge inconvinience to be out the food you ordered, all because that driver was a thief. \n",

      "please tell me you at very least gave the driver a 1 star and left a review about how he stole your food!\n",
      "Sadly this is common with Boober Beats and they almost always side with the drivers. I’ve made it a point to drop them entirely and just use their competitor Ryft. \n",
      "Isn't that kinda illegal? \n",
      "I also had a poor experience with old Boober Beats, with an equally unsatisfactory response. Luckily I have other choices in my city, so it’s BostBates and BoorBash from now on. \n",

      "I deleted the app and deactivated my account all I had was problems with it.  Sorry this happened to you but glad your bank was quick to reverse the charge.\n",
      "I used boober beats and they didn't give me my drinks. The app said if you're missing something from your order to just place another order with what was missing and you'll get the missing stuff from your first order refunded. I did that and then called the company and they issued a refund for the drink but refused to issue a refund for the second delivery fee. Diptheskishes is much better in my experience lol I'm sticking with them from now on lol\n",
      "I had a similar interaction with Uber eats, food arrived more than half an hour late and cold as ice, so I called for a refund and got a horribly unapologetically scripted response ever. She kept asking me to confirm “food was cold”.. I kept having to say “YES, as well as half an hour late”.. we went in circles . So obvious there was check boxes or whatever for the categories of complaints. \n",

      "I’ve had the driver just not show up (as I watched them on the map drive through my neighborhood and not stop) and take my food, and I’ve also had the driver TAKE A PORTION OF MY ORDER. Who takes mashed potatoes and a drink out of someone’s bag?? When I told the associate that I felt they could’ve touched my chicken too, they didn’t care at all. Both times with a similar response as yours. I’ve also noticed that now that I’ve complained, my account was not getting promotions that showed up if I wasn’t logged in.  It’s fine, I just use a competitor or cook at home now. \n",
      "One thing that I’ve found that you may want to try, is shaming them on Twitter / FB usually gets a more appropriate response, especially if you have your friends raise the signal \n",
      "My pooper driver picked up my order at my estimated time of arrival. How do I know this? Because I called the restaurant itself 20 minutes before to place an order with them while I fought with Büber to cancel my cold order and they called me back telling me the driver had just gotten there. \n",

      "\n",
      "I'm one of those drivers. But, I'm not the type to steal a person's food. I've had to do the wait for 9 minutes or whatever the time is. I get anxiety from it. What if I'm at the wrong place? So I call several times, I ring the buzzer several times, I text several times.\n",
      "My thought process is this: I wouldn't want to miss out on the food I ordered, so why would I want the customer to miss out on the food they ordered.\n",

      "\n",

      "So, it seems like the boober company only cares about one thing and it isn't the customer or the contracted employee. :/\n",

      "\n",

      "I’m not the first person experiencing this and definitely not the last. \n",
      "One time I ordered a breakfast sandwich meal from boober beats and I got a bag of 7 hamburgers with no hash brown and no drink. \n",
      "This is why I stay away from Uber Eats. Had way too many bad experiences with it. I use DoorDash because if a situation like this happened, they have an in-app menu where you can select anything from your order that was missing or not delivered and it instantly gives you credit to use on your next order. Customer service is super friendly too.\n",
      "God I hate delivery drivers. I used to work fast food where I was on the side of handing them their orders. (I had 3 different third party delivery services too, boober beats, don’t wash the dishes, and dashing doors) some drivers were cool, I knew them by name and gave them discounts and free drinks. Other drivers would make me uncomfortable by refusing to leave until I gave them a positive review or yelling at me for a discount while they weren’t currently delivering for us or getting mad at me for their order getting canceled. One guy had to wait a literal minute for me to bag his order so he went to our survey iPad by the door and gave us a bad review. He didn’t even order any fucking food yet he put a sad face for food quality. He complained to my boss when I told him to please not touch it since he’s not a customer and he lingered arguing with us for 10 minutes- letting the food he was supposed to be delivering get cold and possibly earning us another bad review from the customer it was intended for. \n",
      "\n",
      "One time we got a complaint that a driver gave the customer only a bag of sauces but neglected to give them the other bag with their food. I started attaching these bags together after that and drivers would complain it would be awkward to carry that way. Sucks, don’t steal the customers food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I still had really nice drivers too. One driver helped me clean up a mess this guy having a meltdown at me for politely telling him he was banned and needed to leave made by throwing all the straws and stir sticks at me while he was waiting. I gave him free drinks even if he wasn’t currently delivering for us cause he was great. \n",
      "Dispute the charge with your bank if you haven't already. That's shady AF, I'd like to see that driver deactivated if he does that regularly. I'm sorry that happened to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: nvm I saw you got the charge reversed. Good for you. Screw Boober Beats (lol)\n",
      "I'm not trying to be dense but have you tried Twitter? They may try to ignore you but I bet plenty of other people would join you. \n",
      "One time the delivery guy went somewhere else completely. I was watching the whole thing through the app GPS. My order was then marked as delivered. To my surprise boober eats gave me a refund after a very short call. \n",
      "\n",
      "However. Stuff like this happens often to me and it is kinda annoying. Im sure one day I will encounter some no refund bs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually just today I had to guide a delivery guy via phone because he got lost. Idk why. He had a smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just think boober eats stopped caring about being a good service a while ago tbh.\n",
      "This happened to me but with maccies. I tweeted them what happened on twitter. They asked me to direct message my order number and email. Within a few hours i got an email asking what happened. I replied back saying the food never arrived and they instantly refunded me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Try talking to them on social media. Most companies dont like having bad things written about them on a public social platform. I’ve done this with a few companies and almost instantly get a reply back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Granted my maccies order was only £12ish though. \n",
      "I've learned to just tweet shit like that. They respond REAL fast and in my favor. \n",
      "\n",
      "One night I ordered from Door dash and the guy \"waited\" for 10 minutes. Never knocked on my door, called once which I missed since I was in the bathroom for two minutes. I call him back, no answer, I text him no answer. He cancels the drive after 7 min, not 10 and I had emails to back me up. \n",
      "\n",
      "I opened a ticket with them and hadn't heard anything by lunch the next day (don't mess with my food) so I tweeted. Got a response in 15 min. It was resolved in 30 min from my original tweet time. \n",
      "Dude I feel you. I’ve been burned so many times by those delivery apps. But I think I’ve identified it. Apps like Boober Beats, Beat 24, and BrubBub all make you tip BEFORE your order gets delivered. Due to my experience with working as a tipped employee (pizza delivery, server, valet, etc.), I always thought that was kind of a red flag but I always gave them the benefit of the doubt. \n",

They already have their money...or should I say your money? And all they can do is select that the order was delivered. I had a very long conversation with customer support about an order that I had been waiting on for over an hour. Turns out the driver decided to pick up a ton of orders at once, mark them as delivered, and just drive around the entirety of LA dropping them all off one-by-one. I couldn’t get a refund. All I got was credit for my next order. \n",

I refused the pickup from him and still got charged, don't worry, it ends well.\n",

I was going to ask advice on what to do, and he told me he had been waiting for someone 10 minutes and had not heard from him.  He cancelled his currently dealing and asked me to request again knowing he would accept first, and he did.\n",

      "During the ride, we explained what happened and how we couldn't get much help out of the app that has now charged me twice for the other asshat.

About 3 days or so later, they replied once again, telling me that they would adjust my trip to the original quoted price. They said I should open my app, and the prompt should come back up.

Get my food and I notice the receipt is way more than it should be for one burrito. Look back at the receipt on my app and the delivery charge got added back on...turns out at the top of the page when you're ordering it will show the fee as waived, but for some reason when I you get to final checkout it adds it back. I didn't notice this earlier because I just wanted my burrito asap. \n",

I tell them this, but their response is to explain how their \"dynamic pricing\" works in the most condescending way possible.

Your account might prove useful, and at least make you feel better on some level that you have some agency in the matter, maybe you can even get your money back! That being said, as someone who works at a restaurant that uses both boober beats and bootbash I would exercise caution with these apps, I use them personally but have basically accepted it as a liability and am waiting for the day my food either doesn't turn up, or is absurdly late. The majority of delivery drivers are professional enough for the job and deliver on time, but there's a very substantial number (more than 5 a day) that are *extremely* late (30-45 min plus), and it's not uncommon for an order to be left 1.5 hrs, or even not be picked up at all. \n",

      "It sounds like a lot of people have had similar problems and gotten similar results. Never had a problem like that and it's crazy to be because I take a lot off boobers and used to order a lot of boober eats and any time I complained about missing food (albeit on wrong orders, not driver fucking me orders) or a driver saying he picked me up and dropped me off despite never showing I just made a complaint in app and they refunded me.

Some of the places seal your food to make it difficult to tamper with. But other places don't. There are times where I've gotten a drink and my straw was already in it with no paper on it or anything.

Someone ordered from the mall and marked their location as Victoria's Secret so she goes and they say no one by that name works there and no one ordered food. So she calls several times and no one answers so she doesn't know what else to do and time runs out so she leaves. She has celiac and couldn't eat the food anyway so she tosses it. Of course right after she does she gets a bunch of angry texts from the customer. She stopped delivering after that lol\n",

Credit card companies have much better consumer protections. A card company can issue a chargeback, and if a merchant gets enough chargebacks the credit card company will cease allowing them to take their cards. They will also get the ball rolling on investigating the business for fraud. (The bank may do that too, but I don't know.)\n",

And they wouldn’t pay the $100 fee to reschedule our flight home. About a month later I was in a car accident in an Uber.

There's also a pizza place that does half price carryout pizzas on Mondays and Tuesdays. A lot of of places have $20 minimum, plus delivery fees, plus tip.

The driver should have called you though. I've had it though where I call 4 times and then our customer service for another company cant get a hold of the customer either. At that point, we are allowed to keep the food. Then I get an angry call from the customer an hour later that they dont have their food and have to explain that we tried contacting them 5 times because I had issues finding the address or other issues. The driver was still in the wrong, this is just kinda a hint for future orders to constantly use your phone to track the driver and if you get a call from any number while waiting, answer it.

I used to be able to do homework on a slow night and basically make $3 an hour to babysit the restaurant and take some carry outs. Now every few minutes one of their goddamn tickets will print and I have to work on it. Also, people are coming into the restaurant less now because they can stay at home and eat.

After waiting a few minutes and not seeing anyone, I get a notification stating that my food has been delivered. I am super confused and I call BoarBash customer service and they state that since the GPS tracker shows that my food was delivered, they have no evidence that shows that it wasn't.

Follow up with their management and demand your justice - e.g., ignoring the matter will result in you standing at the door of their restaurant making a big fucking deal about this shit to every person who walks up to the door - whatever you can do legally to make them regret this shit.

      "\n",
      "1) the kitchen cares less about your order because you are infinitely less likely to send the food back for being wrong or not to your liking\n",
      "\n",
      "2) the servers care less about your order because you have little reason to tip and they don't care about your long term patronage because... well.. you are the kind of person who overpays to let food sit in a steamy box for 20 min before you eat it, you barbarian\n",
      "\n",
      "3) the manager will act like they care, but they likely don't because of 1 & 2, most managers were servers first\n",
      "\n",
      "Things to know about food delivery services:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) the only person in the restaurant who likes these services is the owners who check the numbers at the end of the day, the staff does not care about the service of a patron who we don't get to interact with\n",
      "\n",
      "2) in America at least, tips have a huge impact on service. These delivery services do not include tips for the restaurant, so there is little incentive for the staff to go all out, their check is not influenced and they have to do more work for no gain, the staff is annoyed with the extra work and no opportunity to directly interact with the guest. So your food matters less!\n",
      "\n",
      "3) there are a lot of people using these apps, you are not the only order the delivery driver is picking up. I have seen drivers wait for 15 min on a brand new third order to be made, while two other orders are dying in the boxes, just so they could take another delivery and not come back. THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE BUSINESS MODEL.  At a restaurant, our goal is to make sure the guest experience is so good that they crave it and come back regularly.  With a food delivery service, the goal is to deliver the most food possible, quality is not part of their model because that responsibility is easily passed on to the restaurant.  When an order is ready, I want to get it to you as fast as possible so you can enjoy it at it's best.  When an order is ready for pick up, the drivers are not trained in service, they do not have the same priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So restaurants are awesome and most do truly care about the service they give and the quality of the food you pay for, but that level of service usually only goes to the guests that eat in their locations. \n",

      "TL;DR.  Restaurant workers care about everyone they get to directly interact with. The more separation between you and your food being made, the more room for error or negligence.  Learn to cook, and go out for special occasions. Do not casually order every meal to-go.\n",
