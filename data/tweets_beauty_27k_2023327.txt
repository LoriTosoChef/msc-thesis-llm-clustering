TWEET: Brow Advice for Men:To get the perfect brow, start by drawing a line above your eye with an eyeliner pencil. Then fill in your eyebrows using an eyebrow powder or wax. Finally, brush your brows forward and slightly upward to create a more defined look.  
TWEET: I recently got my first lash lift and tint and I absolutely love the results! I no longer need to use mascara because my lashes look so much thicker and fuller now. 
TWEET: The biggest beauty product letdown for me has to be my eyeliner. I have been using the same eyeliner for years and it has never dried out or smudged, but this new version is terrible. It's so hard to apply and it flakes all over my face. 
TWEET: How to groom your eyebrows: There are a few ways to groom your eyebrows. You can either use an eyebrow brush, an eyebrow pencil, or an eyebrow mascara. You can also use an eyebrow powder if you want a more natural look. If you have a mix between oval and heart shaped eyebrows

TWEET: Hi everyone!! I just removed my lash extensions after having them for about 2 and a half years. (I worked in a salon and got them for free and then moved in with a lash tech who did them for free.) I now have like 10 lashes on each eye, which makes me look really weird. 
TWEET: I love wearing this eye shadow. It is so easy to put on and I can't believe how long it lasts. The only problem is that it gets in my eyes sometimes and I have to stop wearing it because it makes me too irritated. 
TWEET: I've tried so many DIY lash extension kits – Lankiz, various other kits from Amazon, Lilac Street – and none of them have stayed on for more than a day or two, despite all promising a minimum of 7-10 days of wear.

TWEET:  It depends on how dirty a person is. For me, hair washing takes a few minutes per wash because I let the shampoo/ conditioner soak in. And, if a person is quite dirty, it can take a bit of time to get all of it off. So I can understand if a person takes long showers.
